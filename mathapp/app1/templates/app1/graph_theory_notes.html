		<h4 id='topic1'><center>History of Graph Theory</center></h4>

			<hr>

			<p class='paragraphs'>Consider the 18th century problem of 
			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg'>the seven bridges of Konigsberg</a>. In one of 
			the areas of the city lie a network of rivers and bridges, as seen in the diagram below.</p>

			<center><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Konigsberg_bridges.png' width=250 height=250 /></center>

			<p class='paragraphs'>The problem is outlined as follows: Is there a way for a person to travel along each bridge, but only 
			exactly once? In the year 1736, Euler was able to prove that the answer is a definitive no. Given a few trial runs, we may be 
			able to convince ourselves that Euler's conclusion is indeed correct. Only by developing a new form of mathematical analysis, 
			<b>graph theory</b>, was Euler able to show with absolute certainty that indeed there is no solution to this problem, as well as 
			solving a whole host of related problems.</p>

			<p class='paragraphs'>In the map above, we can consider the city of Konisberg to be a planar space. We can think of each land mass as a vertex and the 
			bridges connecting the land masses as edges connecting the vertices:</p>

			<center><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/K%C3%B6nigsberg_graph.svg/180px-K%C3%B6nigsberg_graph.svg.png'width=250 height=250 /></center>

			<p class='paragraphs'>In this way, we are only keeping information relevant to the problem in the diagram and removing all the other 
			details. These schematics like the one above are known as <b>graphs</b>.

<br>

		<h4 id='topic2'><center>Terminology of Graphs</center></h4>

			<hr>

			<p class='paragraphs'><b>Vertices</b> are points on a graph that represent some kind of data. These vertices can be connected 
			by <b>edges</b>. <b>Faces</b> are parts of the plane that are enclosed by edges. If we can draw these vertices and edges such 
			that no edges intersect each other, the graph is called a <b>planar graph</b>.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YPR0GYY/graph-theory1.png" width=300 height=250 alt="graph-theory1" border="0"><br /><br /></center>

			<p class='paragraphs'>In the example shown above, the vertices are A, B, C and D. The edges are AB, AC, BC and CD as they connect 
			these vertices. There are two faces: the one enclosed by ABC, and the rest of the plane. The graph above is planar because the edges 
			do not intersect eachother.</p>

			<p class='paragraphs'>The <b>degree of a vertex</b> is equivalent to the number of edges that extrude from it. In the example above, 
			the degree of vertex C is 3, while the degree of vertex D is 1. The <b>order</b> of the graph is just the number of vertices it 
			contains. The above example has order 4. Two vertices are said to be <b>adjacent</b> if there is an edge that connects them. 
			Below is an example of another planar graph as well as a graph that is not planar.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gmTnh94/graph-theory2.png" width=300 height=250 alt="graph-theory2" border="0"></center>

			<p class='paragraphs'>Let V be any finite set. Then we denote</p>

			<div lang='latex'>[V]^{k}</div>

			<p class='paragraphs'>to be the set of all subsets of V of size k. For our purposes, we will only be focusing on the case k = 2. 
			For example:</p>
			
			<div lang='latex'>
				V = \{a,b,c,d\} \\
				\phantom{aaa} [V]^{2} = \{ \{a,b\}, \{a,c\},\{a,d\},\{b,c\},\{b,d\},\{c,d\}\}
			</div>

			<p class='paragraphs'>A <b>finite simple graph</b> G is given by</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				G = (V,E) \\
				\phantom{aaa} E \subseteq [V]^{2}
			</div>

			<p class='paragraphs'>Take the following example:</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				V = \{a,b,c,d\} \\
				\phantom{aaa} E = \{ \{a,b\}, \{a,c\},\{b,c\},\{c,d\}\}
			</div>

			<p class='paragraphs'>This can be visually represented by the image below.</p>

		<h4 id='topic3'><center>Graphs and their Degree Sequences</center></h4>

		<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>We begin this section with the following theorem. Let G = (V,E) be a finite simple graph. Then</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				\sum_{v \epsilon V} deg(v) = 2|E|
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>This is known as the <b>degree sum theorem</b>. In words: the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number 
		of edges. The proof for this is rather trivial: every edge must be connected to two and only two vertices. QED </p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>A <b>degree sequence</b> of G = (V,E) is the sequence of degrees of vertices of G in decreasing order. A sequence of 
		non-negative integers in decreasing order is <b>graphic</b> if it is the degree sequence of some graph. Let's look at some examples.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'><b>Ex.</b> The degree sequence given by 1, 1, 1 is not graphic because it cannot represent a graph. In this case, the 
		graph would have to contain three vertices, and each vertice would have to be adjacent to exactly one other vertice. This is impossible.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'><b>Ex.</b> The degree sequence given by 1, 1, 1, 1 is graphic. See the diagram below for an example of a graph with 
		this degree sequence.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hFgRh3p/graph-theory4.png" height=250 width=300 alt="graph-theory4" border="0"></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>We now come to the <b>hand shaking lemma</b>. Let G = (V,E) be a finite simple graph. Then the number of vertices in 
		G with odd degree must be an even amount. Stated otherwise:</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				V = (V_{even}) U (V_{odd}) \\ \\
				\phantom{aaa} V_{odd} \ mod(2) = 0
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>So, for example, we know that the degree sequence given by 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1 is not graphic. A degree sequence like 
		4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0 could be graphic, but we do not know from the hand shaking lemma. We simply cannot rule out the possibility that it 
		is graphic from the lemma. A better tool for this is theorem by Hakimi, which we now state.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Consider sequences given by</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				(1)  s_{1}, t_{1}, ... , t_{s}, d_{1},...,d_{n} \\ \\
				\phantom{aaa} (2) t_{1}-1, ... , t_{s}-1, d_{1},...,d_{n}
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Where both sequences are decreasing. Then (1) is graphic if and only if (2) is graphic. Take the following 
		sequence: 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 3, 3, 0. We begin by observing that we cannot dismiss this sequence as not graphical from the hand shakeing 
		lemma. However, we can see that the sequence takes the form of (1) in the above theorem. Applying the theorem, we get</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 3, 3, 0 \\ 
				\phantom{aaa} \ \ \ 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 2, 0 \\
				\phantom{aaa} \ \ \ \ \ \4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0 \\
				\phantom{aaa} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 3, 1, 0, 0, 0 \\
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>The last sequence is clearly not graphic, as show below:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/jgvG1g8/graph-theory5.png" height=250 width=300 alt="graph-theory5" border="0"></center>


		<p class='paragraphs'>So then we know the original sequence cannot be graphic either.</p>

		<h4 id='topic4'><center>Graph Isomorphisms</center></h4>

			<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>In considering graphs, we are especially interested in the structure of each graph (ex its degree, its degree sequence, 
		etc.) rather than how it can be drawn. Take the following two graphs:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/51tg6LZ/graph-isomorphic.png" height=250 width=300 alt="graph-isomorphic" border="0"></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Though they have been drawn differently, the two graphs have the same number of edges, degree and degree 
		sequence. The overall structure of the graphs are identical. This is is contrast to the two graphs given by:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fXG6KXb/graph-noniso.png" height=250 width=300 alt="graph-noniso" border="0"></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Though these two graphs have the same number of degree and edges, they differ in degree sequence. The first graph has 
		a degree sequence of 3, 1, 1, 1 while the second graph has a degree sequence of 2, 2, 1, 1. These two graphs are structurally different. This 
		leads us to the following definition.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Two finite simple graphs</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				G_{1} = (V_{1},E_{1}) \ \ \ G_{2} = (V_{2},E_{2})
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>are said to be <b>isomorphic</b> if there exist a bijection</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				f: \ V_{1} \ \longrightarrow \ V_{2}
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>that satisfies the following condition: For and u and v in V1 that are adjacent in G1, f(u) and f(v) 
		are in V2 and are adjacent in G2.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>The diagram below shows all graphs of degree 3 up to isomorphism.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/CHF49h0/graph-theory-iso3.png" height=250 width=300 alt="graph-theory-iso3" border="0"></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>There are certain structural properties of a graph that will remain unchanged under isomorphism. Such a concept 
		is known as </b>isomorphic invariance</b> of a graph. There are many examples of these, and we will discuss a few now.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>The order of a graph G = (V,E) : |V| is one such isomorphic invariant. In other words, if we have to graphs that 
		are isomorphic, then they must contain the same number of vertices. This is a trivial result.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>The degree sequence of a graph must be isomorphic invariant, as must the sum of all degrees of a graphs vertices. 
		From this it also follows that the number of edges of a graph is an isomorphic invariant.</p>

		<h4 id='topic5'><center>Graph Classes</center></h4>

			<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Certain types of graphs are important and frequent enough that they deserve their own classification. Here is a 
		selection of some of these graphs.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'><b>Path of length n</b></p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			K_{n} = (V = \{(1,...,n\}, \ E = [V]^{2} )

		<p class='paragraphs'>In other words, all vertices are connected to each other.</p>

			\phantom{aaa} |V_{1}| = n, \ |V_{2}| = m
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>In other words, every vertex in V1 connects with a vertex in V2, however no vertices in V1 are adjacent with other

		<h4 id='topic6'><center>Subgraphs</center></h4>

			<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Loosely speaking, a <b>subgraph</b> H of a graph G = (V,E) is a graph that is a smaller version of G. That is to 
		say, we can take out some of the edges and/or vertices of G, and if we are still left with a graph, then we have obtained a subgraph of 
		F. In this sense, the vertices of H are a subset of the vertices of G, and the edges of H are a subset of the edges of G. Take the following 
		example:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7gf59z9/subgraph.png" alt="subgraph" border="0" height=250 width=300></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Clearly, the graph H is a subgraph of G. A nice thing about subgraphs is the following: If a given graph G has a 
		subgraph H and G is isomorphic to G', then there will exist a subgraph of G', H', such that H is isomorphic to H'.</p>

	</div>

<br>
<br>

	<div class='content'>

		<h4 id='topic7'><center>Adjacency Matrices and Graph Eigenvalues</center></h4>

			<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Let's look at the following two isomorphic graphs:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gRd5BFf/adjacency-graphs.png" alt="adjacency-graphs" border="0" height=250 width=300></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>We can create an <b>adjancency matrix</b> for each graph, where the ij-th entry is equivalent to 1 if the 
		vertex i is adjacenty to the vertex j, and 0 otherwise. In the first example, the matrix would be</p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			\begin{bmatrix}
				0&1&0 \\
				1&0&1 \\
				0&1&0
			\end{bmatrix}
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>And the second matrix would be given by:</p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			\begin{bmatrix}
				0&1&1 \\
				1&0&0 \\
				1&0&0
			\end{bmatrix}
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>There are some properties of adjacency matrices that are evident:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>All diagonal entries must be 0</li>
			<li>The sum of entries in the ith row or column is the same as the degree as the ith vertex</li>
			<li>The sum of all entries in all rows/columns is the same as the sum of the degrees of all vertices of the graph</li>
			<li>They are symmetric</li>
			<li>The sum of all eigenvalues are zero</li>
		</ul>

		<p class='paragraphs'>This last point is not as obvious. But in fact it implies something stronger: all adjaceny matrices of a graph 
		G = (V,E) have the same eigenvalues, regardless of how we choose to enumerate the vertcies. In other words: the <b>characteristic 
		polynomial of a graph G</b> is the characteristic polynomial for any of the adjacency matrices of G.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>An <b>induced subgraph</b> of a graph G = (V,E) is a subgraph H = (V',E'), where V' is a subset of V, and E' contains 
		all the edges in G between elements in V'.</b>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Given a finite simple graph G, we define the following quantities:</p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			\Delta(G) = \max_{v \ \epsilon \ V} \{deg(V)\} \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} \delta(G) = \min_{v \ \epsilon \ V} \{deg(V)\}
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Now we have the following theorem which relates the spectrum of eigenvalues of a graph G to the maximum of the 
		above values. Suppose G is a finite simple graph. Then</p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			-\Delta(G)  \ \leq \ \lambda \ \Delta(G) \ \ \forall \ \lambda \ \epsilon \ spec(G)
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Proof: Let x be an eigenvector that is not 0. Then we have</p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			Ax = \lambda x \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} |\lambda||x_{i}| = |\lambda x_{i}| \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} = |(\lambda x)_{i}| \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} = |(Ax)_{i}| \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} = |\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}x_{j}| \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} \leq \sum_{j=1}^{n} (a_{ij}|x_{j}|) \ \ \(by \ \Delta \ inequality) \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} \leq (\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij})|x_{i}| \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} = deg(V_{i}|x_{i} \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} \implies |\lambda||x_{i}| \ \leq \ \Delta(G)|x_{i}| \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} |\lambda| \ \leq \ \Delta(G)

			<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Suppose we have a graph G = (V,E). We call H = (V',E') with V = V' a <b>spanning subgraph</b> of G. In words, 
		this means that H will have the same number of vertices as G, but a subset of its edges. A <b>spanning tree</b> of G is a spanning 
		subgraph of G that is also a tree. Take the example below</p>

<center><img src='https://i.ibb.co/ZgNwK8r/spanning-tree.png' height=250 width=300></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Here we see that H is a spanning tree of G. It might also be obvious to state the following theorem at this 
		point: If G = (V,E) is connected, then it has a spanning tree.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>An edge e in a graph G is a <b>bridge</b> if G is connected and G-e is not connected. In the example below, 
		e is a bridge of G. If we removed e, G would no longer be connected.</p>

<center><img src='https://i.ibb.co/Dz1p3GB/bridge-bank.png' height=250 width=300></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>In the above graph, the subgraphs h1 and h2 are called <b>banks</b>. Two connected components are called banks. 
		If e is a bridge in G and H1 and H2 are banks, then we have: s(G) = s(H1)s(H2), where s stands for the number of spanning trees in a 
		graph. In the above example, s(H1) = 3 and s(H2) = 3, so s(G) = 9.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Recall that Kn is the complete graph on n vertices. Then we have the following fact about the number of spanning 
		trees for Kn:</p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			s(k_{n}) = n^{n-2}
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Take the example of k3 below. We can find 3 trees for k3, and indeed, 3 to the power of 3-2 is 3.</p>

<center><img src='https://i.ibb.co/QpNSCY2/spanning-kn.png' height=250 width=300></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Note also that although each tree is isomorphic to the other, this is not what we are interested in. We are 
		focused on how many trees we can make that are not identitical up to a <b>labelling</b> of the vertices.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Recall that Kn,m is the complete bipartite graph on m and n vertices. Then we have the following fact about 
		the number of spanning trees for Kn,m:</p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			s(k_{n,m}) = m^{n-1}n^{m-1}
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>In general, it is difficult to simply enumerate by the naked eye how many spanning trees a particular graph G 
		may have. Fortunately, there is the following theorem that will help us compute this quantity for a graph G = (V,E).</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Let G = (V,E) be a graph with adjacency matrix A. If D is the matrix given by</p>

		<div lang='latex'> D = 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				d_{1}&0&...&0 \\
				0&d_{2}&...&0 \\
				0&0&...&d_{n}
			\end{bmatrix} \\ \\

		\phantom{aaa} d_{i} = deg(V_{i})
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Then we define the matrix L = D - A and the matrix M obtained by deleting the last row and the last column of L. 
		Then we have s(G) = det(M).</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Consider the following example:</p>

<center><img src='https://i.ibb.co/3B52WTv/s-g-example.png' height=250 width=300></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>For this graph, we have:</p>

		<div lang='latex'> D = 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				2&0&0&0 \\
				0&2&0&0 \\
				0&0&1&0 \\
				0&0&0&3 \\
			\end{bmatrix} \\ \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} A = 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				0&1&0&1 \\
				1&0&0&1 \\
				0&0&0&1 \\
				1&1&1&0 \\
			\end{bmatrix}
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>We obtain L from the difference of D and A, and M from the deletion of the 4th row and 4th column of L:</p>

		<div lang='latex'> L = 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				2&-1&0&1 \\
				-1&2&0&-1 \\
				0&0&1&0 \\
				-1&-1&-1&3 \\
			\end{bmatrix} \\ \\ \\
			\phantom{aaa} M = 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				2&-1&0 \\
				-1&2&0 \\
				0&0&1 \\
			\end{bmatrix}
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>From this we have det(M) = 3. In this case, we can directly count the number of spanning trees of G by construcing 
		them if we please.</p>
