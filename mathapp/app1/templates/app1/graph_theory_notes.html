		<h4 id='topic1'><center>History of Graph Theory</center></h4>

			<hr>

			<p class='paragraphs'>Consider the 18th century problem of 
			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg'>the seven bridges of Konigsberg</a>. In one of 
			the areas of the city lie a network of rivers and bridges, as seen in the diagram below.</p>

			<center><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Konigsberg_bridges.png' width=250 height=250 /></center>

			<p class='paragraphs'>The problem is outlined as follows: Is there a way for a person to travel along each bridge, but only 
			exactly once? In the year 1736, Euler was able to prove that the answer is a definitive no. Given a few trial runs, we may be 
			able to convince ourselves that Euler's conclusion is indeed correct. Only by developing a new form of mathematical analysis, 
			<b>graph theory</b>, was Euler able to show with absolute certainty that indeed there is no solution to this problem, as well as 
			solving a whole host of related problems.</p>

			<p class='paragraphs'>In the map above, we can consider the city of Konisberg to be a planar space. We can think of each land mass as a vertex and the 
			bridges connecting the land masses as edges connecting the vertices:</p>

			<p class='paragraphs'>In this way, we are only keeping information relevant to the problem in the diagram and removing all the other 
			details. These schematics like the one above are known as <b>graphs</b>.

		<h4 id='topic2'><center>Terminology of Graphs</center></h4>

			<hr>

			<p class='paragraphs'><b>Vertices</b> are points on a graph that represent some kind of data. These vertices can be connected 
			by <b>edges</b>. <b>Faces</b> are parts of the plane that are enclosed by edges. If we can draw these vertices and edges such 
			that no edges intersect each other, the graph is called a <b>planar graph</b>.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YPR0GYY/graph-theory1.png" width=400 height=250 alt="graph-theory1" border="0"><br /><br /></center>

			<p class='paragraphs'>In the example shown above, the vertices are A, B, C and D. The edges are AB, AC, BC and CD as they connect 
			these vertices. There are two faces: the one enclosed by ABC, and the rest of the plane. The graph above is planar because the edges 
			do not intersect eachother.</p>

			<p class='paragraphs'>The <b>degree of a vertex</b> is equivalent to the number of edges that extrude from it. In the example above, 
			the degree of vertex C is 3, while the degree of vertex D is 1. The <b>order</b> of the graph is just the number of vertices it 
			contains. The above example has order 4. Two vertices are said to be <b>adjacent</b> if there is an edge that connects them. 
			Below is an example of another planar graph as well as a graph that is not planar.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gmTnh94/graph-theory2.png" width=400 height=250 alt="graph-theory2" border="0"></center>

			<p class='paragraphs'>Let V be any finite set. Then we denote</p>

			<div lang='latex'>[V]^{k}</div>

			<p class='paragraphs'>to be the set of all subsets of V of size k. For our purposes, we will only be focusing on the case k = 2. 
			For example:</p>
			
			<div lang='latex'>
				V = \{a,b,c,d\} \\
				\phantom{aaa} [V]^{2} = \{ \{a,b\}, \{a,c\},\{a,d\},\{b,c\},\{b,d\},\{c,d\}\}
			</div>

			<p class='paragraphs'>A <b>finite simple graph</b> G is given by</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				G = (V,E) \\
				\phantom{aaa} E \subseteq [V]^{2}
			</div>

			<p class='paragraphs'>Take the following example:</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				V = \{a,b,c,d\} \\
				\phantom{aaa} E = \{ \{a,b\}, \{a,c\},\{b,c\},\{c,d\}\}
			</div>

			<p class='paragraphs'>This can be visually represented by the image below.</p>

		<h4 id='topic3'><center>Graphs and their Degree Sequences</center></h4>

		<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>We begin this section with the following theorem. Let G = (V,E) be a finite simple graph. Then</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				\sum_{v \epsilon V} deg(v) = 2|E|
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>This is known as the <b>degree sum theorem</b>. In words: the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number 
		of edges. The proof for this is rather trivial: every edge must be connected to two and only two vertices. QED </p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>A <b>degree sequence</b> of G = (V,E) is the sequence of degrees of vertices of G in decreasing order. A sequence of 
		non-negative integers in decreasing order is <b>graphic</b> if it is the degree sequence of some graph. Let's look at some examples.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'><b>Ex.</b> The degree sequence given by 1, 1, 1 is not graphic because it cannot represent a graph. In this case, the 
		graph would have to contain three vertices, and each vertice would have to be adjacent to exactly one other vertice. This is impossible.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'><b>Ex.</b> The degree sequence given by 1, 1, 1, 1 is graphic. See the diagram below for an example of a graph with 
		this degree sequence.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hFgRh3p/graph-theory4.png" height=250 width=400 alt="graph-theory4" border="0"></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>We now come to the <b>hand shaking lemma</b>. Let G = (V,E) be a finite simple graph. Then the number of vertices in 
		G with odd degree must be an even amount. Stated otherwise:</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				V = (V_{even}) U (V_{odd}) \\ \\
				\phantom{aaa} V_{odd} \ mod(2) = 0
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>So, for example, we know that the degree sequence given by 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1 is not graphic. A degree sequence like 
		4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0 could be graphic, but we do not know from the hand shaking lemma. We simply cannot rule out the possibility that it 
		is graphic from the lemma. A better tool for this is theorem by Hakimi, which we now state.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Consider sequences given by</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				(1)  s_{1}, t_{1}, ... , t_{s}, d_{1},...,d_{n} \\ \\
				\phantom{aaa} (2) t_{1}-1, ... , t_{s}-1, d_{1},...,d_{n}
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Where both sequences are decreasing. Then (1) is graphic if and only if (2) is graphic. Take the following 
		sequence: 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 3, 3, 0. We begin by observing that we cannot dismiss this sequence as not graphical from the hand shakeing 
		lemma. However, we can see that the sequence takes the form of (1) in the above theorem. Applying the theorem, we get</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 3, 3, 0 \\ 
				\phantom{aaa} \ \ \ 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 2, 0 \\
				\phantom{aaa} \ \ \ \ \ \4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0 \\
				\phantom{aaa} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 3, 1, 0, 0, 0 \\
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>The last sequence is clearly not graphic, as show below:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/jgvG1g8/graph-theory5.png" height=250 width=400 alt="graph-theory5" border="0"></center>


		<p class='paragraphs'>So then we know the original sequence cannot be graphic either.</p>

	</div>

	<div class='content'>

		<h4 id='topic4'><center>Graph Isomorphisms</center></h4>

			<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>In considering graphs, we are especially interested in the structure of each graph (ex its degree, its degree sequence, 
		etc.) rather than how it can be drawn. Take the following two graphs:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/51tg6LZ/graph-isomorphic.png" height=250 width=400 alt="graph-isomorphic" border="0"></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Though they have been drawn differently, the two graphs have the same number of edges, degree and degree 
		sequence. The overall structure of the graphs are identical. This is is contrast to the two graphs given by:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fXG6KXb/graph-noniso.png" height=250 width=400 alt="graph-noniso" border="0"></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Though these two graphs have the same number of degree and edges, they differ in degree sequence. The first graph has 
		a degree sequence of 3, 1, 1, 1 while the second graph has a degree sequence of 2, 2, 1, 1. These two graphs are structurally different. This 
		leads us to the following definition.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Two finite simple graphs</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				G_{1} = (V_{1},E_{1}) \ \ \ G_{2} = (V_{2},E_{2})
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>are said to be <b>isomorphic</b> if there exist a bijection</p>

			<div lang='latex'>
				f: \ V_{1} \ \longrightarrow \ V_{2}
			</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>that satisfies the following condition: For and u and v in V1 that are adjacent in G1, f(u) and f(v) 
		are in V2 and are adjacent in G2.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>The diagram below shows all graphs of degree 3 up to isomorphism.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/CHF49h0/graph-theory-iso3.png" height=250 width=400 alt="graph-theory-iso3" border="0"></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>There are certain structural properties of a graph that will remain unchanged under isomorphism. Such a concept 
		is known as </b>isomorphic invariance</b> of a graph. There are many examples of these, and we will discuss a few now.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>The order of a graph G = (V,E) : |V| is one such isomorphic invariant. In other words, if we have to graphs that 
		are isomorphic, then they must contain the same number of vertices. This is a trivial result.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'>The degree sequence of a graph must be isomorphic invariant, as must the sum of all degrees of a graphs vertices. 
		From this it also follows that the number of edges of a graph is an isomorphic invariant.</p>

		<h4 id='topic5'><center>Graph Classes</center></h4>

			<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Certain types of graphs are important and frequent enough that they deserve their own classification. Here is a 
		selection of some of these graphs.</p>

		<p class='paragraphs'><b>Path of length n</b></p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			P_{n} = (V = \{0,1,...,n\}, \ E = \{(i,i+1) \ | \ i = 0,...n-1 \})
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'><b>Cycle of length n</b></p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			C_{n} = (V = \mathbb{Z} / \mathbb{Z}_{n}, \ E = \{(i,i+1) \ | \ i \ \epsilon \ \mathbb{Z} / \mathbb{Z}_{n} \} )
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'><b>Complete graph on n vertices</b></p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			K_{n} = (V = \{(1,...,n\}, \ E = [V]^{2} )
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>In other words, all vertices are connected to each other.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/096C7RY/complete-graph-on-n-vertcies.png" alt="complete-graph-on-n-vertcies" border="0" height=250 width=300></center>


		<p class='paragraphs'><b>Complete bi-partite graph on n and m vertices</b></p>

		<div lang='latex'>
			K_{n,m} = (V = V_{1} \ U \ V_{2}, \ E = \{(v_{1},v_{2}) \ | \ v_{1} \ \epsilon \ V_{1} \ \ v_{2} \ \epsilon \ V_{2} ) \\
			\phantom{aaa} |V_{1}| = n, \ |V_{2}| = m
		</div>

		<p class='paragraphs'>In other words, every vertex in V1 connects with a vertex in V2, however no vertices in V1 are adjacent with other 
		vertices in V1, and the same is true of V2.</p>

	<div class='content'>

		<h4 id='topic6'><center>Subgraphs</center></h4>

			<hr>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Loosely speaking, a <b>subgraph</b> H of a graph G = (V,E) is a graph that is a smaller version of G. That is to 
		say, we can take out some of the edges and/or vertices of G, and if we are still left with a graph, then we have obtained a subgraph of 
		F. In this sense, the vertices of H are a subset of the vertices of G, and the edges of H are a subset of the edges of G. Take the following 
		example:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7gf59z9/subgraph.png" alt="subgraph" border="0" height=250 width=300></center>

		<p class='paragraphs'>Clearly, the graph H is a subgraph of G. A nice thing about subgraphs is the following: If a given graph G has a 
		subgraph H and G is isomorphic to G', then there will exist a subgraph of G', H', such that H is isomorphic to H'.</p>
